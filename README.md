# Enhancing portfolio optimization with machine learning methods: A comparative study using commodity markets data

<p align="justify">
Portfolio optimization is essential in financial mathematics, focusing on achieving the best trade-off between risk and return through effective asset allocation. This study evaluates various portfolio optimization methods, including traditional techniques like Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and advanced approaches involving machine learning, applied to commodity markets. MPT helps investors create diversified portfolios by considering expected returns and asset covariances. Extensions of MPT address issues like estimation errors and include factors such as transaction costs, tax effects, and multi-period optimization. Alternative risk measures such as Conditional-Value-at-Risk (CVaR) and robust optimization techniques enhance portfolio performance. Risk-based allocation methods, like risk parity (RP) and hierarchical risk parity (HRP), aim to distribute risk equally without relying on return estimates. Machine learning has also been applied to portfolio optimization. Techniques like Support Vector Machine (SVM) combined with MPT and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have shown significant improvements in portfolio performance and decision-making.

This study provides a comprehensive comparison of portfolio optimization techniques using commodity price data, considering short selling and using an equal-weighted portfolio as a benchmark. Performance metrics such as Sharpe and Sortino ratios are calculated for 100 portfolio simulations. The study focuses on seven different commodity groups, filling a gap in the literature that predominantly emphasizes equity markets.
